# Bridge Pattern

**Goal:**
---

- we split a large set closely related classes into two separate hierarchies ( abstraction and implementation ), which can be developed independently of each other.

- allows us to extend a class into several different hierarchies which are connected, or inter-related.

**Pros:**
---

- Open/Closed Principle. You can introducce new abstractions and implementations, independently of each other.
