# ITERATOR Pattern

**Goals:**
---

- Lets you traverse the elements of a collection without exposing it's underlying representation.

**JDK Use:**
---

- `java.util.Iterator`

**Pro:**
---

- Lets a complex data structure, expose a way to traverse through itself.

- A data structure is in control of how it is traversed, and hence it allows a more efficient and uniform way of traversing itself.
